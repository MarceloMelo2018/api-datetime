# REST API with Spring Boot, that returns Date and Time according to Timezone

Bootcamp Project NTT DATA BRASIL, mentored by Rodolfo Azevedo - NTT DATA.

Content-rich project, where I could go deeper into the concepts and implementation of REST API with Spring boot, which certainly added a lot to my knowledge. Very good!
